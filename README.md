# OutlierDetection

Outliers are extreme values that deviate from other observations on data. They may be due to random variation or may indicate something scientifically interesting.
Outliers can either give us information about specific localized data or possible fraud cases. It's important to detect the outliers in data analysis. In this particular example, Tukey method is used to detect the outliers. Whisker length is taken as 3.0 on purpose while it's normally 1.5. Linear regression is used to fit the data and data is visualized before and after outlier removal. Required data.csv can be found in the repository.
